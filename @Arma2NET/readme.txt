Arma2NET 1.11.1 - https://bitbucket.org/Scott_NZ/arma2net

 Arma2NET is a wrapper used for communicating between managed code and SQF code used in the game Arma 2, adding significant functionality to SQF scripting.

 Arma2NET gives you the ability to use the .NET Framework from Arma 2. It is designed to be an alternative for those who don't want to use C or C++ with callExtension or Java and the JVM.

 There is a wide range of language implementations that target the Common Language Runtime, so you can use C#, Python, VB.NET, F#, Ruby code and more, directly from Arma 2.

Features

 - Call managed functions and manipulate the return value from SQF.
 - Check the status of long-running managed functions from SQF using callbacks.
 - Convert SQF literals (lists, strings, numbers etc) to .NET objects and back.
 - Extend the functionality of Arma2NET by writing plugins written in any language that compiles to .NET bytecode, such as C#, F# or VB.NET.

Requirements

 To use Arma2NET, you must be running Arma 2 beta version 87640 or later, and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (Download it from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24872).

Installation

 If you're using the installer, simply click through the prompts, checking that the installation folder is correct.
